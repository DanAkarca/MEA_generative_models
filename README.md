## **Requirements**

The following installations are required to use all the attached scripts. However, most will be usable with MATLAB alone. Installation time on a typical computer should take no longer than 60 minutes.

•	MATLAB 2019b (installation: https://uk.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html)

•	Brain Connectivity Toolbox, 2019 (installation: https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/)

•	See the remaining requirements in **/toolboxes**

## **Data availability**

All pre-processed and generative model data can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/6362134#.YjHLbi-l2J9

For each script within this repository, you will need to set your own path to the data in addition to the toolbox folder.
